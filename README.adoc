= Deploy Avi Controller using Terraform

This deploys a new controller using Terraform in AWS. Within a few changes you can deploy it in Azure.

== Credentials

Using AWS profile now


My Example:
----
[default]
access_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
secret_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

[avi]
aws_access_key_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
aws_secret_access_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
----

You could overwrite the profile with the following:
----
terraform plan -var region=us-west-1 -var profile=default
----
This will not use the avi profile even though it's in the variables


== AMI
I implemented the map options and based on your regions it will pick the AMI. YOu can add more AMI as needed

to overwrite a region you can use the following command:

----
terraform plan -var region=us-west-1
----
